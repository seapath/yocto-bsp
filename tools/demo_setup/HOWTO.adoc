HA demonstration setup how-to
=============================

== Presentation
Demo setup allows you to quickly set up a HA cluster as describes
https://r1.sfl.team/projects/rte-votp/wiki/Our_HA_setup[here]:

This script will setup:

- one HP server as SEAPATH1 hypervisor ; IP address 192.168.217.131
- another HP server as SEAPATH2 hypervisor ; IP address 192.168.217.132
- Advantech server as observer ; IP address 192.168.217.133

== Prerequisite
- All machines must be flashed with seapath distribution and must be accessible on
the network.
- You must have created a config.ini file at the root of this directory. This file
describes the cluster to setup. You can refer to the example files in the
example folder.
- A NTP server must be available at 192.168.217.134

== Configuring the cluster
Simply run the demo_setup.sh script at the root of the demo_setup folder.
You can specify a custom configuration file path with -c parameter.
For example:

 $ ./demo_setup.sh -c myconfig.ini

Wait for setup to finish.

== Add a VM disk
Run the script import_vm_disk.sh at the root of the demo_setup folder.
This script takes as parameter the disk image to be imported in qcow2 format.
You can use --name or -n parameter to specify the name of the disk to be given
in the cluster. For example:

 $ ./import_vm_disk.sh image.qcow2 -n disk

== Add a VM
Run the script add_vm.sh at the root of the demo_setup folder.
The script need parameters:

- --id:        The VM id. It is a unique number per VM between 0 and 99
- --interface: The network interface to use: kernelbr0 or kernelbr1 and ovs
              according to the cluster configuration defined in config.ini.
- --disk:      The name of the disk to use (the one defined above). It is an
              optional parameter. The default name is disk.
For example:

  $ ./add_vm.sh --id 0 --interface ovs --disk disk

== Cluster status
To monitor the cluster and the VMs you can use the script cluster_status.sh.
On "Node list" you can found the hypervisor status. On "Full List of Resources"
you can found all the VM, there state and and which hypervisor host its.

== About this documentation

This documentation uses the AsciiDoc documentation generator. It is a convenient
format that allows using plain-text formatted writing that can later be
converted to various output formats such as HTML and PDF.

In order to generate an HTML version of this documentation, use the following
command (the asciidoc package will need to be installed in your Linux
distribution):

  $ asciidoc HOWTO.adoc

This will result in a README.html file being generated in the current directory.

If you prefer a PDF version of the documentation instead, use the following
command (the dblatex package will need to be installed on your Linux
distribution):

  $ asciidoctor-pdf HOWTO.adoc
